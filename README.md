Goal: Build a physics informed surrogate model for the forward problem without scattering effect.

Frederik currently works on the paper Probabilistic 3D-Reconstruction of Spectral Line Observations (p3droslo) which first implements the forward function in PyTorch and benefits from automatic differentiable functionality and will then solves the inverse problem of reconstructing a model. Presently, the PyTorch implementation of the forward problem in this study affords Shiqi the opportunity to generate simulated data needed to train a network.
